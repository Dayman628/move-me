## User Story

As an individual with a busy schedule, Iâ€™m in need of assistance with my moving needs. I need to know where I can rent a truck nearby, find movers, find moving supplies or find a storage facility.

Deployed website can be found at [this link](https://move-me-by-glass.netlify.app/).

## Usage 
When first entering the site, user is able to get their current address. If entering an address as is in the search bar, address may autocomplete if need be.

Once address is searched, the main page appears with all options checked by default, and those options appear on the map as small icons.

Each icon on the map displays a different filter - movers, storage, and rent a truck, in the actual location. Any time an option is unchecked, those filters show on the screen along with their Yelp reviews, and the weather for that city.
